<h1>Cache and Cookies: Explained</h1>


<p>
The browser cache is a temporary storage location on your computer for files downloaded by your browser to display websites.
Files that are cached locally include any documents that make up a website, such as HTML files, CSS style sheets, JavaScript scripts, as well as graphic images and other multimedia content.

When you revisit a website, the browser checks which content was updated in the meantime and only downloads updated files or what is not already stored in the cache. This reduces bandwidth usage on both the user and server-side and allows the page to load faster.

Cookies are small pieces of information websites store on your computer. Cookies only contain bits of text, not anything else. The text can be a user ID, session ID, or any other text. For example, web pages can be configurable â€“ a web page could have a Hide link that hides a certain element on the page. The page can save this setting on your computer with a cookie. When you load the page in the future, the page can examine the cookie and automatically hide the element. Since cookies control the repeated display of popups in a browser, through remembering that a form was filled out, deleting them would prompt the form to appear again to the same user.
